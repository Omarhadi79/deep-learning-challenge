Step 4: Write a Report on the Neural Network Model

For this part of the assignment, youâ€™ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for Alphabet Soup.
The report should contain the following:

1. Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
2. Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

--- Data Preprocessing

Q- What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model? 
A- The target variable is the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column.

Q- What variable(s) are the features of your model?
A- Remaining columns from application_df after dropping 'IS_SUCCESSFUL'.

Q- What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
A- 'EIN' and 'NAME' columns were excluded as they weren't targets or features.

--- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

Q- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
A- First try: 8 nodes in layer1, 5 in layer2 - random for iteration.

Q- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
A- I wasn't able to

Q- What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
A- Tried more layers, columns, nodes, and activations for better accuracy.

3. Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.

-The model demonstrated a notable accuracy of 73%. However, better correlation and cleanup could improve accuracy with different activations and iterations.
